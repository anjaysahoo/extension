## Focus Mode

### _Inject scripts into the active tab_

In this guide, we're going to explain how to do the following:

- Use the extension service worker as the event coordinator.
- Preserve user privacy through the "activeTab" permission.
- Run code when the user clicks the extension toolbar icon.
- Insert and remove a style sheet using the Scripting API.
- Use a keyboard shortcut to execute code.

This code won't work on Brave as it for chrome based browsers like Chrome, Edge etc
